            <p class="presentacion__contenido__texto">
                For almost a year now I have been taking programming courses in Javascript, Python and SQL languages.
                Browsing LinkenIn I came across the proposal offered by the Oracle ONE program and decided to apply for it.
                Luckily, several months later I received an email that I had been selected and later I managed to complete the selection stage
                to begin studies.

                A little more about me... I really like reading, video games and writing. I am a very curious person and I like to be 
                constantly in contact with new knowledge. I always try to give my best version and be a good person, 
                both for myself and for the other.
